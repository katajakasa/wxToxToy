wxToxToy
========

wxWidgets3 based Tox client. Note: this is a toy project, something I just slapped quickly together to
take a peek at Tox clients and wxWidgets3. This is NOT meant for use, and it may or may not work/build.
I take absolutely no responsibility if your house burns (or something) because of this code.
